This privacy policy applies to the "My buddy Nounours", "Bugdroid Buddy" and "Nounours and friends" Android applications, hereafter "the app". 

* The app does not contain ads.
* The app does not request the permission to access the internet.
* The app does not connect to the internet.
* The app cannot send any data to the internet.
* The app provides a sharing function: You may record an animation and share it. The animation does not contain personally identifying information.  It contains a sequence of pre-defined images of the character of the app. When you share an animation, you, the user, manually choose another app with which to share the animation. This other app you choose, and not "the app", sends the animation to the internet.
* If the app encounters an error, an error message may be written to the device logs. No personally identifying information is contained in the error. One example of such an error message is "Couldn't create a bitmap to save the animation.  Probably out of memory".
* The developer of the app has no interest in your data.
